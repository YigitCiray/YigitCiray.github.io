### #🛡️Mobile Application Security #💻SoftwareDevelopment #📱iOS 
I got my certificate of completion for [Mobile Security Course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs215-mobile-security) from Stanfrod University School of Engineering. 
In this post, I would like to share my notes about the course, my learnings and what I was expecting from this course, before I purchase.

Mobile security is crucial. Should be handled properly to protect confidential and expose private data of user. Security always considered as everyone's responsibility, but at the same time we know that when everyone is responsible, no one is!
