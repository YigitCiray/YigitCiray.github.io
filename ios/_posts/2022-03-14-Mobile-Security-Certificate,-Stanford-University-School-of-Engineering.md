### #üõ°Ô∏èMobile Application Security #üíªSoftwareDevelopment #üì±iOS 
I got my certificate of completion for [Mobile Security Course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs215-mobile-security) from Stanfrod University School of Engineering. 
In this post, I would like to share my notes about the course, my learnings and what I was expecting from this course, before I purchase.

## What was my motivation?
Mobile security is crucial. Should be handled properly to protect confidential and prevent exposing private data of user. Security always considered as everyone's responsibility, but at the same time we know that when everyone is responsible, no one is! 
## Why did I choose this course?
**First**, there are not much course options when the topic is Mobile Security. 
**Second**, this course is promising to provide an in-depth technical overview of the security features and limitations of modern mobile operating systems, including the top risks and vulnerabilities, every IT professional needs to know.
**Third**, and most important one, my fellow tweeps recommended me this course.

## My Knowledge Gain
This course is not iOS specific, all sort of security vulnerabilities on mobile devices, including, tablets and watches with phones, proactively mentioned with historical data/previous deficiencies.
My first learning from the course is threat definitions for Privacy and Security. **Privacy:** data and identifier leakage
**Security:** phishing, malware & drive-bys malicious intents

## What are the main fundamental differences and similarities between mobile and traditional malwares?
This is quite meaningful question to understand the perspective of hackers. My main note for this question is the volume of data stolen with the attack. Traditional attacks on web tends to expose high volume of user data, while on mobile there is an individual users information. This is an advantage of the mobile development with highly secure SDKs, which by defaults protects with user and provices ready to use APIs for developers.

## Who is OWASP? 
The [Open Web Application Security Project¬Æ (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. 
OWASP's Mobile Top 10 Mobile Risks list
1. Improper Platform Usage
2. Insecure Data Storage
3. Insecure Communication
4. Insecure Authentication
5. Insufficient Cryptography
6. Insecure Authorization
7. Client Code Quality
8. Code Tampering
9. Reverse Engineering
10. Extraneous Functionality
