### #üõ°Ô∏èMobile Application Security #üíªSoftwareDevelopment #üì±iOS 
I got my certificate of completion for [Mobile Security Course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs215-mobile-security) from Stanfrod University School of Engineering. 
In this post, I would like to share my notes about the course, my learnings and what I was expecting from this course, before I purchase.

## What was my motivation?
Mobile security is crucial. Should be handled properly to protect confidential and prevent exposing private data of user. Security always considered as everyone's responsibility, but at the same time we know that when everyone is responsible, no one is! 
## Why did I choose this course?
**First**, there are not much course options when the topic is Mobile Security. 
**Second**, this course is promising to provide an in-depth technical overview of the security features and limitations of modern mobile operating systems, including the top risks and vulnerabilities, every IT professional needs to know.
**Third** and most important one, my fellow tweeps recommended me this course.
