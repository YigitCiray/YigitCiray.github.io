### #🛡️Mobile Application Security #💻SoftwareDevelopment #📱iOS 
I got my certificate of completion for [Mobile Security Course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xacs215-mobile-security) from Stanfrod University School of Engineering. 
With this post, I would like to share my notes about the course, my learnings and what I was expecting from this course, before I purchase.
