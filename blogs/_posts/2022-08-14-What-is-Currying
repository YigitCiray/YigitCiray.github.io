## #üß®FunctionalProgramming 
Currying is a functional programming concept which look familiar to me from iOS World but I never thought that this is a concept with a name.

## What is Currying?
Currying is a great way to create compositional functions. What is that mean? It means making it more reusable. Can't we call our functions compositional which can take other function(s) as a parameter? Yes, we can but currying is an effort which transforms your ad-hoc function into more reusable one.

Currying is a transformation from 
```swift
f(a, b, c)
```
to
```swift
f(a)(b)(c)
```
It is a helper method to **transform** your method.

## Example
```swift
func valuedMember(since date: Date, name: String) -> String {
    let format = DateFormatter()
    format.dateFormat = "yyyy"
    let year = format.string(from: date)
    return "\(name) is a valued member since \(year)."
}

// Curried version of the above method
func valuedMember(since date: Date) -> (String) -> String {
    return { name in
        let format = DateFormatter()
        format.dateFormat = "yyyy"
        let year = format.string(from: date)
        return "\(name) is a valued member since \(year)."
    }
}

//Method to Curry the methods
func curry<A, B, C>(_ f: @escaping (A,B) -> C) -> (A) -> (B) -> C {
    return {a in { b in f(a,b) } }
}

```
valuedMember(since:name:) 			**(Foundation.Date, String) -> String**
valuedMember(since:) 				**(Foundation.Date) -> (String) -> String**
curry(valuedMember(since:name:)) 	**(Foundation.Date) -> (String) -> String**

## Usecase
Let's assume that we can use either today's year or sometime which should be provided as a parameter. Let's have a one liner for multiple use.
```swift
let curried = curry(valuedMember(since:name:))(Date())
curried("David")
curried("Joe")
```
"David is a valued member since 2022."
"Joe is a valued member since 2022."

Our first method(valuedMember(since:name:)) is curried with curry(...) and this constant's first parameter is initiated with (Date()).

I'll repeat this, constant's **only** parameter is initiated with (Date()).
Yes, that is the goal, we would like to create a method from an existing method, which needs only one argument rather than two. 

Lastly, this method, which has the first parameter set, is called with other strings, as expected as a second parameter.


## Why it is called currying?
It is not Steph! Yeah! Name is coming from [Haskell Curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying). He is the programmer who socialized the the concept while Moses Sch√∂nfinkel is the founder.
