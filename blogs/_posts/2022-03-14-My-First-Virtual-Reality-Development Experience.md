I have been interested in Virtual Reality Glasses, hardware and software developments around 6 years now. My interest was mostly stayed on following articles and hardwares rather than working on real software until late February 2022.

I purchased [Oculust Quest 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest_2) glass to experience Meta's hardware. Previously, I had a chance to try [Hololens 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HoloLens) by Microsoft. Hololens introduced as MR, Mixed Reality back then, I was in the meetup back in 2017. It was a good experience to see overall and stahelped me to imagine what to expect from the industry. Biggest downside that I can recall from that meet up from 5 years a go is the battery. Battery was lasting 45 minutes in heavy use. It is great to see that experience can last longer around 3 hours.
