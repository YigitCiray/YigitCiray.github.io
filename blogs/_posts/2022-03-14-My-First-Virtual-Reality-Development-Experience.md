I have been interested in Virtual Reality Glasses, hardware and software developments around 6 years now. My interest was mostly stayed on following articles and hardwares rather than working on real software until late February 2022.

I purchased [Oculust Quest 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Quest_2) glass to experience Meta's hardware. Previously, I had a chance to try [Hololens 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_HoloLens) by Microsoft. Hololens introduced as MR, Mixed Reality back then, I was in the meetup back in 2017. It was a good experience to see overall and stahelped me to imagine what to expect from the industry. Biggest downside that I can recall from that meet up from 5 years a go is the battery. Battery was lasting 45 minutes in heavy use. It is great to see that experience can last longer around 3 hours. 

## My VR Development Experience
It was a HackWeek for Twitter on early March. As a new tweep, I decided to work on a project. HackWeek is a culture, and great way to feel the company's spirit. I can not share much details about my project but I worked on a VR application and developed usign Unity.
### What did I learn?
I am an iOS Engineer and I will compare this experience with my iOS development experience.
**First**, debugging what you have on Unity on your glass is fairly easy. Literally, you just switch on your developer mode and game is on! 
**Second**, what I do in daily life is, I create playgrounds and new XCode projects just to test and try, this is not as easy as I thought on Unity because all the projects that I added Oculus Integration Library has 3GB size. I realised that right after my 4th project. So, rather than learn each step on different projects, this is normally what I do, I think it is a great way to redo things and learn by not looking, I incrementally added what I had in mind one by one to the project. 
**Third**, 3D design is hard but so much fun with Unity! Maybe I enjoyed because I debugged and experienced each step with my Oculus glass. This was also the same reason, how I spent a lot of time on iOS development back in 2015, write and debug on your mobile device and experience your code. 
**Fourth**, how design interacts with code? This was a question that I would like to answer, and I purchased few courses on Udemy. Most of them focusing on how do you use preferences on Unity, which is I am not sure if developers job in VR development team, most likely this should be the designer's responsibility. The part that I interact with code was assigning specific functionalities on actions such as buttons. I used C# to interact with other components which was super cool experience.
