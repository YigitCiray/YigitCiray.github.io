### #ðŸ§­DesignPatterns #ðŸ’¡OOP #ðŸ’»SoftwareDevelopment

How do you measure the quality of the code? Can we consider that one way is looking into the collaboration among its objects? How do you decide on collaboration between objects when you plan your code? Focusing on these questions can lead you to come up with a simpler and understandablea architecture.

## Why do we need Design Patterns?
We, software developers, need to communicate with each other about the coding solution that they are actively working on or planning to start. Considered that using a pattern name can save us on explained details of thousands word, design patterns making our life easier. Increase the collaboration while keeping the software development on track. On Gang of Four's [Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) book there are four essential elements:
1. The pattern name is a handle we can use to describe a design problem
2. The problem describes when to apply the pattern
3. The solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationshipsm, responisbilities and collaborations.
4. The consequences are the result and trade-offs of applying pattern.

"Inheritance", "Encapsulation" and "Polymorphism" not explained in this book as a design pattern becuase programming languages used for problemsare not procedural languages. I am planning to create a post for these three and link to this blog.

## How do we categorize Design Patterns?
### Creational Patterns
- Abstract Factory #Object
- Builder #Object
- Factory Method #Class
- Prototype #Object
- Singleton #Object

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter #Class and #Object
- Bridge #Object
- Composite #Object
- Decorator #Object
- Facade #Object
- Flyweight #Object
- Proxy #Object

### Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility #Object
- Command #Object
- Interpreter #Class
- Iterator #Object
- Mediator #Object
- Memento #Object
- Observer #Object
- State #Object
- Strategy #Object
- Template Method #Class
- Visitor #Object
