### Object Oriented Programming - #Design Principle
My fifth and last post on Principles is about SRP, this is the fifth of reverse order of -S-OLID principles with this blog post.

You can find my other blog posts [Open-Closed Principle](https://ihadahamoment.com/The-Open-Closed-Principle-(OCP)/), [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://ihadahamoment.com/Liskov-Substitution-Principle-(LSP)/), [Interface Segregation Principle](https://ihadahamoment.com/Interface-Segregation-Principle-(ISP)/) and [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://ihadahamoment.com/Dependency-Inversion-Principe-(DIP)/)

For Uncle Bob, RSP considered as the least well understood principle because of it's inappropriate name and assumption of every module should do one thing.
